Web Services
	- a service is, essentially, software that provides services
	  to other components over a network
	- a web service is the above, where the network is the internet
	- follows service-oriented architecture (SOA)
		1. logically represents a business activity with a
		   specified outcome
		2. self-contained
		3. black box for consumers (they don't know the details
		   of their interaction with the software)
		4. may consist of underlying services (doesn't have to)
	- two main types
		- SOAP: simple object access protocol. older, more rigid
		  design, transfers XML documents, any protocol
		- REST: representational state transfer. newer, more
		  flexible, transfers any type of document, protocol
		  must be HTTP
REST
	- REpresentational State Transfer
	- a web service architecture designed by Roy Fielding
	- transfer the state of a representation of an object to a database
	- a RESTful web service must meet the following constraints:
		1. client-server architecture: the front end and back end
		   of the application are two separate applications (i.e.
		   Java back end, Angular/React/etc. front end)
		2. statelessness: the server does not store client context
		   between requests, all necessary information is sent to
		   the server in every request from the front end
		3. cacheability: particular responses from the back end are
		   able to be cached for easy reuse, especially if they are
		   used often
		4. layered system: the user cannot tell whether there are
		   any intermediaries between them and the database
		5. code on demand: OPTIONAL. where necessary, the back end
		   can send scripts to offer additional functionality to
		   the front end as a response.
		6. uniform interface: requests/responses use the following
		   patterns:
			i. URI model: requests are sent in a particular
			   format: /collection/identifier
			ii. resources are manipulated through representations,
			   i.e. when changes are made, they are made to the
			   representations being sent, rather than in the
			   back end after certain directions were given.
			iii. self-descriptive messages: a GET request to
			   "/cat" should get the cats.
			iv. HATEOAS: hypermedia as the engine of application
			   state. when a resource has a lot of information,
			   it can include URIs so that the client can send
			   requests to those URIs for further information.
HTTP
	- hypertext transfer protocol: a client-server protocol
		- client to server = front-end to back-end
		- client initiates the communication
	- follows a request-response format, sort of like sending a letter
	  then receiving one back.
	- http requests consist of:
		- verb: what HTTP method is being used
		- URI: the endpoint of the requested resource
		- HTTP version
		- request header: metadata
		- request body: message content
	- http responses consist of:
		- status code
		- http version
		- response header: metadata
		- response body: message content
	- http methods (verbs)
		- GET: used for retrieving a resource or set of resources.
		  request body is empty.
		- POST: sends an entity for the server to accept, usually
		  used for creating/adding resources (a POST request in a
		  RESTful application should be sent to the URI of a
		  collection, e.g. "/collection" with no identifier), often
		  also used for logging in
		- PUT: sends an entity for the server to accept, usually
		  used for updating resources (a PUT request in a RESTful
		  application should be sent to the URI of the specific
		  entity being changed, e.g. "/collection/identifier")
		- DELETE: specifies an entity to be deleted (URI pattern
		  should be same as PUT), often also used for logging out
		- OPTIONS: sent by the browser, checks which verbs are
		  allowed on the specified endpoint before actual request
		  is sent there
	- idempotence: if a function is idempotent, you can repeat it over
	  and over with exactly the same results
		- GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent: the results after
		  performing the method will be the same if you repeat it
		- POST is not idempotent
	- status codes
		- 100s: informational
		- 200s: success
			- 201: created
		- 300s: redirect
		- 400s: client error
			- 400: bad request
			- 401: unauthorized (must be logged in)
			- 403: forbidden (cannot access even if logged in)
			- 404: not found
			- 405: method not allowed
			- 418: i'm a teapot (cannot brew coffee)
		- 500s: server error
			- 500: internal server error
			- 503: service unavailable (usually for maintenance)
Servlets
	- a servlet is an object that handles requests and responses
	- servlet hierarchy:
				Servlet (interface)
		GenericServlet (AC)		FacesServlet (C)
		HTTPServlet (AC)
	- servlets are not part of Java standard library
		- javax.servlet (javax = java extensions) can be included
		  from the Maven repository
		- OR tomcat catalina can be used, which includes that package
		  and acts as our servlet/web container
	- web container
		- tomcat is our web container
		- manages servlet environment and lifecycle
		- reads deployment descriptor (web.xml)
		- calls the servlet lifecycle methods:
			- init: initializes the servlet, called once
			- service: is called every time a request is received
			- destroy: called when app stops running, once
	- deployment descriptor (web.xml)
		- file that describes how an application should be
		  deployed by the server
		- right click on project that has been set up to be
		  packaged as a war file > Java EE Tools > Generate
		  Deployment Descriptor Stub
		- this is where we define and map our servlets so that the
		  web container knows where to find them and what requests
		  to send to them
		- <servlet>
			<servlet-name>Name</servlet-name>
			<servlet-class>com.revature.servlets.Name</servlet-class>
		  </servlet>
		  <servlet-mapping>
			<servlet-name>Name</servlet-name>
			<url-pattern>/name</url-pattern>
		  <servlet-mapping>
	- each servlet will get a class, and in that class you can set up
	  overridden methods for each HTTP method
		- protected void doGet (HttpServletRequest req,
			HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException,
			IOException {
				// this handles GET requests.
			}
		- protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req,
			HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException,
			IOException {
				// this handles POST requests.
			}
		- etc.
	- PrintWriter
		- the printwriter is an object that you get from the response object
			- resp.getWriter();
		- this allows you to write directly to the response body using .write()
		- you can write plain text, JSON, HTML, XML, etc. whatever is relevant
		  to the particular response and application in general
	- <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
		- in web.xml, allows you to set the web container to call
		  the "init" lifecycle method for the servlet right when
		  the application starts rather than waiting until it
		  receives its first request
	- because the web container (tomcat) gains control of our program,
	  there is NO main method
