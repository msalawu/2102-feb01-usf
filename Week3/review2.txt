Servlets continued
	- config vs. context
		- in the web.xml (deployment descriptor), you can specify servlet config
		  and context
		- config: parameters for a particular servlet
			- <init-param>
				<param-name>paramName</param-name>
				<param-value>paramValue</param-value>
			  </init-param>
			- inside of the servlet tag for that servlet
		- context: parameters for all of the servlets in the application
			- <context-param>
				<param-name></param-name>
				<param-value></param-value>
			  </context-param>
			- at the same level as the servlet tags
	- redirect vs. forward
		- forwards happen in the web container; the URL still reflects the request
		  made when it gets back to the client but the response came from a different
		  one (the one that we forward the request to)
			- req.getRequestDispatcher("/newURI").forward(req, resp);
		- redirects send a response that triggers a new request to be made to the new
		  URI that it is redirected to; the URL will be replaced with the new one
			- resp.sendRedirect("newURI");
	- Sessions
		- a session represents an object that persists between requests from the
		  same client (identified by an ID from the browser)
		- there are three ways to associate a client with a session (i.e. maintain
		  session identity), these are managed on the front end
			1. cookies
			2. URL rewriting (putting information in the URL)
			3. hidden form fields
			- you don't need to worry about these too much as you will not be
			  managing them in your API
		- HttpSession object, retrieved from the request
		- req.getSession()
		- session.setAttribute("name", value)
		- session.getAttribute("name")
		- session.invalidate()
Design Patterns
	- MVC: Model View Controller
		- controller handles request flow
		- model handles data access/CRUD
		- view handles presentation rendering (for server-side rendering)
		- model & view NEVER interact, only accessed by the controller.
	- Front Controller
		- front controller sends requests to handler/dispatcher
		- handler/dispatcher decides which delegate to send request to
		- front controller then sends the request to the appropriate delegate
		- delegate ("logic class") handles CRUD, presentation, etc.
		- can go hand-in-hand with MVC
