Angular
	front-end framework
	used to make dynamic, single-page applications
	allows you to have readable, modular code
	made by Google
	originally it was written in JS (AngularJS), then after version 1.7 it became Angular and was written in TS
	modules, components, services, classes
	commands:
		npm install -g @angular/cli
			- installs the angular command line interface
		ng new app-name
			- creates a new angular project
		ng generate
			- shortened to ng g
			- ng g component componentName, or ng g c componentName
			- ng g service serviceName, or ng g s serviceName
			- ng g class className
			- ng g module moduleModule
		ng serve
			- serves the project locally, by default on port 4200
		ng test
			- runs protractor & jasmine tests (spec.ts)
		ng build
			- builds the final application files that can be deployed
	the setup of the project
		angular.json: angular settings
		tsconfig.json: settings for typescript, like transpiling target
		package.json: npm dependencies
		src/app is where our files will be
	module
		like a mini-application for specific tasks
		root module is AppModule
	component
		what you're actually using to build the page
		comprised of 4 parts
			- component.html: the html for the component
			- component.css: the css for the component
			- component.ts: the typescript for the component
			- component.spec.ts: the unit tests for the component
		the page that you see in an angular application is built by many components
		the html from components is sometimes referred to as templates
	service
		an object used by another object as a dependency
		it's usually a layer between the visual presentation of the app (components) and the logic/data
		angular documentation says that any reusable code could be a service
	class
		models for your data/objects, usually the objects that you're getting from the back end
		not necessary, but it's a good way to ensure that your JSON is being mapped correctly
	directives
		custom HTML tags/attributes
		3 types
			component: the HTML tag used to reference a component.
				<app-componentName></app-componentName>
			structural: the directive that affects the DOM; whether elements show up or not using conditionals/loops.
				*ngIf, *ngFor, etc.
			attribute: the directive that affects the "look" of elements
				<div ngStyle="color:blue;"></div>
				<div appCustomDirective></div>
	services
		services are specified with the @Injectable decorator
		they are any code that could be reusable and injected as a dependency into other classes (components)
		dependency injection
			Angular uses constructor injection
			constructor (private pokemonService: PokemonService)
			because we gave the object an access modifier, Angular knows we need this to be an object-level field
				then when Angular constructs the component, it can inject the service
			services that are to be injected also must be in the app.module.ts in the providers array
	http
		HttpClient object that allows us to send requests
		must add HttpClientModule to the imports array in the app.module.ts
		this.http.get('url').pipe( map(resp => resp as Pokemon) );
			http is our HttpClient object
			.get sends a GET request (.post would send POST request, etc.)
			.pipe allows us to return an Observable
			map allows us to take the JSON data and make it into an object
		regular JS allows asynchronous calls with Promises
		in Angular we can use Observables from rxjs
			- an observable is basically allowing an asynchronous call and giving us a stream of events
				(sort of like how our plain AJAX calls had the readystatechange events)
			- to use an Observable (to start the stream), we have to subscribe to it
			- we get the Observable from a service, then subscribe:
				this.pokemonService.getPokemonById(this.id).subscribe(
					resp => {
						this.pokemon = resp;
					}
				);
	data binding
		a way of making communication easier between the HTML/DOM and the TypeScript
			- typically we would be using lots of document.getElementById()
			- allows you to put these connections directly into the HTML (less JS!)
		4 main types of data binding
			- property binding []
				- in the .ts file: let colorVar = blue;
				- in the .html file: <div [style]="'color:'+colorVar"></div>
				- goes from TS -> HTML
			- interpolation {{ }}
				- in the .ts file: let username = "sierra";
				- in the .html file: <p>{{ username }}</p>
				- goes from TS -> HTML
			- event binding ()
				- in the .ts file: function doClick() { window.alert('thing!'); }
				- in the .html file: <button type="button" (click)="doClick()">Submit</button>
				- goes from HTML -> TS
			- two-way binding [( )]
				- in the .ts file: let usernameInput = "Enter Username";
				- in the .html file: <input name="user" [(ngModel)]="usernameInput">
				- goes both ways HTML <-> TS
